Moodle Versions
===============
20200506 I assumed maintenance responsibility for this plugin.


=== 3.8.5 === pending
20230406 Skype_1033 - Invalid event functions defined in \mod_skype\event\course_module_viewed.
    Removed the deprecated function. 


=== 3.8.4 ===2022120200
20220803 Skype_903 - Deleting Skype activity should not delete the users Skype ID
    from the user profile. For now I have just commented out portions of the
    skype/db/uninstall.php file so that only the Skype activities are deleted and
    profiles are not touched.
20221130 Skype_970 - The skypecheck.js file needs commented out code cleanup. Removed
    unneeded comments and code.

=== 3.8.3 ===2022062900
20220614 Skype_872v - Need upgrade.php code added like I have in the install.php file
    for the new fields. Created new code.

=== 3.8.2 ===2022032100
20220311 Skype_829v - Missing completion information on the view.php page. Set the case
    in lib.php to true and added the code in view.php to give the basic 'view'
    completion.
20220319 Skype_830v - Exception - Using $this when not in object context. Replaced
    ten lines of code with simpler, two lines of code. See the ticket for details.
20220321 Skype_832v - $string['skypeid'] = 'Skype ID2'; needs to be removed from
    deprecated list and modified. Changed the string by removing the, 2, so that
    it became, $string['skypeid'] = 'Skype ID'; Also, removed it from the
    deprecated part of the language list and placed it alphabetically where it
    should be.
20220321 Skype_833v - Need new skype_supports($feature) for Moodle 4.0. See the
    ticket for details. Rewrote the function to work like it does in Diary.
20220325 Skype_706v - Need to fix code style errors/warnings. Ran through and fixed
     all the errors and warnings listed on Moodle for Skype v3.8.1.
20220330 Skype_835v - The oops.php page is not triggered when Skype software is NOT
    installed on the user clients computer. There was a camel case name error in
    results.php which caused the skypecheck.js file to not be loaded. In it there
    was a location and name error oops.php. Both are now fixed.

=== 3.8.0/1 ===2021072800/2022031600
Most of this was done for internal 3.8.0 that was never released. Release was
    done as 3.8.1 only.
20210503 Skype_708v - Need code for GDPR compliance. Got an email with pull request info.
    Looked at the code and merged the pull request. Adds code to use the following
    string: $string['privacy:metadata'] = 'Skype module does not store private data.';
20210526 Skype_725v - Text for view.php error in line 55 is hardcoded and needs to be
    a string. Added new code for the error and the new string.
20210601 Skype_709v - Need to remove escape characters in script in locallib.php.
    20210601 As of this date, locallib.php has been discarded and the functions
    moved to /skype/classes/local/results.php. Changes were made as needed.
20210602 Skype_726v - Multiple places and files need change to (__DIR__) in require_once.
    Made changes in multiple files. See the ticket for details.
20210725 Skype_728v - install.php needs updating for Moodle 3.11. Began code development
    and made changes as needed. Seems to be working correctly.
20210727 Skype_729v - uninstall.php needs to be created for Moodle 3.11. Created file and
    just checked code.
20210726 Skype_727v - Convert from lib.php cron function to /classes/task/cron_task.php.
    Created skype/db/tasks.php. Created skype/classes/task/cron_task.php. Created
    new string, $string['crontask'] = 'Background processing for Skype module';
20210726 Skype_705v - Optional field, Skype, missing in Moodle 3.11. Created code
    changes as needed to use new tables and fields for Moodle 3.11 and higher. Initial
    version of Moodle 3.11 has problems with some other fields created as part of
    this change. Due to extreme health issues for my wife that lead to her death,
    I tabled work on this until 20220313. I have ran tests and it seems to upgrade
    in Moodle 3.11 and work as expected.

=== 3.7.0 ===2021042800
20210430 Skype_312/393v - Some lines are too long, over 132 characters. Fixed all line
    lengths being reported by codechecker.
20210430 Skype_323/704v - missing, With Selected (through check boxes): below user
    list. 20210428 There was one problem and a mistake. The js folder was missing
    because I tried moving its contents to two other files. Currently have deleted
    the folder and both files. The problem was caused by me breaking up the lines
    of a script, WITHOUT concatenating them!
20200506 Skype_393v - Many lines of code longer than 132 characters. Fixed the 
ones in php. Still working on the others.

=== 3.6.1 ===2021012900
20210129 Fixed variable name capitalization error in backup_skype_activity_task.class.php file.
20210205 Skype_667v - user found bugs. See the ticket. Mostly resolved by getting rid
    of locallib.php and making classes out of each function. 
20200506 Skype_392v - Some variables have underscores in the names. Ran codechecker
    and fixed variables with underscores in them.
20200506 Skype_394v - Added a branch check to add deprecated
    update button ONLY in Moodles 3.1 and lower. Otherwise, skip adding it.
20200514 Skype_395v - Removed mod_form heading, Custom example fieldset, and
    moved the, Next chat time, setting so that is under the Availability heading.
20200516 Skype_406v - locallib.php line 96, variable $all_userskype, is incorrect
    and appears to be unused. In locallib.php, removed unused
    line 96, $all_userskype = '';.


=== 3.6.0 ===2020052000
20200506 Started work on new Skype v3.6.0.
20200514 Completed more code cleanup and documentation.
20200516 Completed more code cleanup, mostly fixing line lengths.
20200516 Skype_407v Started converting oops.html to oops.php and moving all
    the css style entries to a styles.css file. 20210729 As of this date, I
    have completely removed the skype_not_found folder. I renamed oops.html
    to oops.php and moved it into the main skype folder. I moved bg.png into
    the pix folder.
20200518 Skype_407v Got oops.php working with bg.png moved to the pix folder,
    but still need to verify that oops.php gets called into action.
20200520 Push all recent changes to github, with bump to this version.
