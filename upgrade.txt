Moodle Versions
===============
20200506 I assumed maintenance responsibility for this plugin.
=== 3.8.4 ===
20220803 Skype_903 - Deleting user profile should not delete the users Skype ID.
    Commented out lines of code doing the delete. 

=== 3.8.3 ===
20220614 Skype_872 - Need upgrade.php code added like I have in the install.php file
    for the new fields. Created new code.

=== 3.8.2 ===
20220311 Skype - Missing completion information on the view.php page. Set the case
    in lib.php to true and added the code in view.php to give the basic 'view'
    completion.
20220319 Skype_830 - Exception - Using $this when not in object context. Replaced
    ten lines of code with simpler, two lines of code.
20220321 Skype_832 - $string['skypeid'] = 'Skype ID2'; needs to be removed from
    deprecated list and modified. Changed the string by removing the, 2, so that
    it became, $string['skypeid'] = 'Skype ID'; Also, removed it from the
    deprecated part of the language list and placed it alphabetically where it
    should be.
20220321 Skype_833 - Need new skype_supports($feature) for Moodle 4.0. Created
    two versions of the switch ($feature), and added a branch check to control
    which is used. The first switch includes the needed new feature, while the
    second, does not.
20220325 Skype_706 - Need to fix code style errors/warnings. Ran through and fixed
     all the errors and warnings listed on Moodle for Skype v3.8.1.
20220330 Skype_835 - The oops.php page is not triggered when Skype software is NOT
    installed on the user clients computer. There was a camel case name error in
    results.php which caused the skypecheck.js file to not be loaded. In it there
    was a location and name error oops.php. Both are now fixed.


=== 3.8.0/1 ===
Most of this was done for internal 3.8.0 that was never released. Release was
    done as 3.8.1 only.
20210503 Skype - Need code for GDPR compliance. Got an email with pull request info.
    Looked at the code and merged the pull request. Adds code to use the following
    string: $string['privacy:metadata'] = 'Skype module does not store private data.';
20210526 Skype_725 - Text for view.php error in line 55 is hardcoded and needs to be
    a string. Added new code for the error and the new string.
20210601 Skype_709 - Need to remove escape characters in script in locallib.php.
     20210601 As of this date, locallib.php has been discarded and the functions
     moved to /skype/classes/local/results.php. Changes were made as needed.
20210602 Skype_726 - Multiple places and files need change to (__DIR__) in require_once.
    Made changes in multiple files. See the ticket for details.
20210725 Skype_728 - install.php needs updating for Moodle 3.11. Began code development
    and made changes as needed. Seems to be working correctly.
20210727 Skype_729 - uninstall.php needs to be created for Moodle 3.11. Created file and
    just checked code.
20210726 Skype_727 - Convert from lib.php cron function to /classes/task/cron_task.php.
    Created skype/db/tasks.php. Created skype/classes/task/cron_task.php. Created
    new string, $string['crontask'] = 'Background processing for Skype module';
20210726 Skype_705 - Optional field, Skype, missing in Moodle 3.11. Created code
    changes as needed to use new tables and fields for Moodle 3.11 and higher. Initial
    version of Moodle 3.11 has problems with some other fields created as part of
    this change. Due to extreme health issues for my wife that lead to her death,
    I tabled work on this until 20220313. I have ran tests and it seems to upgrade
    in Moodle 3.11 and work as expected.
